# Persistent Pattern Detector

A fast, privacy-first web app to find and visualize repeating patterns in your text or sequence dataâ€”entirely in your browser.

## Features
- **Client-side only:** No data ever leaves your device. All processing is local.
- **Text input or file upload:** Paste or type text, or upload a `.txt` file.
- **Pattern detection:** Finds all repeating substrings of configurable minimum length (default: 2).
- **Case sensitivity:** Option to treat uppercase/lowercase as the same or different.
- **Interactive results:**
  - List of detected patterns (with counts)
  - Click a pattern to focus its highlights in the text
  - Color-coded, accessible highlights in your input
- **Persistence:** Remembers your last input and settings using browser local storage.
- **Responsive & accessible:** Works on desktop and mobile, keyboard accessible, high-contrast highlights.
- **No dependencies:** Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Works offline after first load.

## How to Use
1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
2. **Enter or paste your text** in the input area, or upload a `.txt` file.
3. **Adjust settings** (minimum pattern length, case sensitivity) as needed.
4. **Click "Detect Pattern"** to analyze your input.
5. **View results:**
   - Patterns are listed with counts. Click a pattern to focus its highlights in the text.
   - If no patterns are found, you'll see a message.
